# Init Rules

Read and understate
- Project References

## Project References
- Amazon Q Developer cli which our mcp server need to communicate with is in this directory:
  - /Users/sawitmee/Code/amazon-q-developer/references/amazon-q-developer-cli/
- Guideline MCP servers for referent is in this directory:
  - /Users/sawitmee/Code/amazon-q-developer/references/mcp/src/cost-analysis-mcp-server/

## Hard Doundery
- Don't access any files beyond project directory except explicily allow by me.
- Don't run `uvx` for testing. It will cause you struck and cannot continue.
